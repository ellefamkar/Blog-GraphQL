## My process

### Where to find resources

The first think to do is to look for your perfect design! So let's checkout [dribble](https://dribbble.com/) for our favourite design to begin!

### Built with

- Reactjs
- GraphCMS (Hygraph)
- Apollo Client
- GraphQL
- Material-UI (MUI)
- React Router
- Mobile-first workflow
- DOMPurify
- React Toastify

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a try. However, i made it responsive for all the devices, since my users should be able to: View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### What I learned

This projects helped me getting more deep on GraphQL and using queries and mutations while practicing more on MUI, use MUI components, handle form errors using toastify and  create a responsive project with small details on colors,sizes and so on.

To see parts of my codes and see how you can add code snippets, see below:

``` JSX

 const navigate = useNavigate();
  const { slug } = useParams();
  const { loading, data, error } = useQuery(GET_BLOG_INFO, {
    variables: {
      slug,
    },
  });

  return (
    <>
      {loading ? (
        <Loader />
      ) : error ? (
        <p>{error}</p>
      ) : (
        <Container maxWidth="lg">
          <Grid container spacing={2}>
            <Grid
              size={{ xs: 12 }}
              mt={9}
              display="flex"
              justifyContent="space-between"
              alignItems="center"
              sx={{
                flexDirection: { xs: "column-reverse", sm: "row" },
                textAlign: { xs: "center", sm: "left" },
              }}
            >
              <Typography
                component="h3"
                variant="h4"
                color="primary.dark"
                fontWeight={700}
                sx={{
                  mt: { xs: 4, sm: 0 },
                }}
              >
                {data.post.title}
              </Typography>
              <ArrowCircleRightOutlinedIcon
                sx={{ cursor: "pointer" }}

                width="100%"
                style={{ borderRadius: 15 }}
              />
            </Grid>
            <Grid size={{ xs: 12 }} mt={4} display="flex" alignItems="center">

                </Box>
              </Link>
            </Grid>
            <Grid size={{ xs: 12 }} mt={1}>
              <div
                className="blog-content"
                dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
                  __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(data.post.content.html),
                }}
              ></div>
            </Grid>
            <Grid size={{ xs: 12 }}>
              <CommentForm slug={slug} />
            </Grid>
            <Grid size={{ xs: 12 }}>
              <Comments slug={slug} />
            </Grid>
          </Grid>
        </Container>
      )}
    </>
  );

```
